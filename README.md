> Code refactor 
The aim of Code refactor is to take existing code and refactor it to either meet a certain set of standards or implement a new technology. Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses, ensuring that people with disabilities or socio-economic restrictions have access to their website, and helping them avoid litigation.

## Goals

- implement semantic HTML elements 
- ensure that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
- img elements contain accessible alt attributes
- heading attributes fall in sequential order
- concise, descriptive title
